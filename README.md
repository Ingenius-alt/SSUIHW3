Also the custom interactor is a recreation of the sisyphus tale. When you click on him at the bottom of the hill you can help him go up the mountain by going to the next region you cannot make him skip up the mountain. Also if at any point you release the mouse sisyphus will fall down the mountain. He only falls if any event happens which is not a problem if you do anything inside the regions but if you release outside the big region there will be no events that can happen but once you go back into the region he will begin to fall.
